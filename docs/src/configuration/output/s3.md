# S3

To use S3 output mode, first prepare a configuration file for AWS with the
official [AWS Command Line Interface](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/):

```bash
aws configure
```

PacketStreamer uses credentials stored in the config file generated by AWS CLI.

Then launch PacketStreamer with S3 output enabled in configuration. This
command points to our example config file:

```bash
./packetstreamer receiver --config ./contrib/config/receiver-s3.yaml
```

The config part relevant for S3 settings is:

```yaml
output:
  s3:
    bucket: _name_
    region: _region_
    keyFormat: _date_format_   # default: /packetstreamer/%Y/%m/%d/%H/%M/%S
    totalFileSize: _size_      # example: 5 MB, 100 KB; default: 1 MB
    uploadTimeout: _time_      # example: 30s, 2m; default: 1m
```

For example, you could specify all options in the following way:

```yaml
output:
  s3:
    bucket: mybucket
    region: us-east-1
    keyFormat: /dump/%m-%d-%Y-%H:%M:%S
    totalFileSize: 2 MB
    uploadTimeout: 30s
```
